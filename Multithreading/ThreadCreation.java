         - When you extend Thread class, you canâ€™t extend any other class which you require.
         - As you know, Java does not allow inheriting more than one class.
         - When you implement Runnable, you can save a space for your class to extend any other class in future or now.
        However, the significant difference is:
         - When you extend Thread class, each of your thread creates unique object and associate with it.
         - When you implement Runnable, it shares the same object to multiple threads.
